This directory contains various 3rd party classes and libraries that will be maintained by the Blackprint CMS project.    
It's not pretty and in some cases Composer could (and maybe should) be used, but for now we have this until things can be cleaned up.    
These classes, libraries, and other scripts contain code that isn't as important to keep up to date as well.
