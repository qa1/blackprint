    	<p>
    	Blackprint is an open-source CMS to serve you and your projects from prototype to production. It uses MongoDB for flexibility as well as scalability and it is built
    	on top of the wonderful <a href="http://li3.me" target="_blank">Li3 framework.</a> The goal is to provide many boilerplate features that don't belong in frameworks.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Blackprint includes OAuth support for many services right out of the box along with a blog and user management system. Keep in mind that there is an MVC framework
    	underneath, so it's perfect to build your web application on alongside everything. The best way to organize things is by putting code into "libraries" and the
    	view templates for each library can be overridden by putting a template in the base "views" directory under a matching path. This way, you never have to fork
    	anything and things are kept nice and organized.
