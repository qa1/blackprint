/**
 * Use this file as a guide when adding your own libraries.
 * Any file within file within the `libraries` directory will be loaded.
 * This directory is purposely added to .gitignore, so you if you wanted
 * to add these files to your own repository, you will need to do so with
 * the -f flag to force adding them.
 *
 * So for example, you'll want to include Lithium's `Libraries` class and
 * then simply add any additional library with `Libraries::add()`
 *
 * NOTE: You can load other libraries that don't conform to PSR-0 as well.
 * See: http://lithify.me/docs/manual/extending-lithium/third-party-libraries.wiki
 *
 * EXAMPLE CODE:
 * use lithium\core\Libraries;
 * Libraries::add('your_library');
